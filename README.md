# Multiscale-KMC-with-SA
Two time scale well-mixed kinetic Monte Carlo. Multiscale likelihood ratio sensitivity analysis is done on the fly. Implemented in Matlab.

Code used in A. Hashemi, M. Nunez, P. Plechac, D.G. Vlachos, “Stochastic Averaging and Sensitivity Analysis for Two Scale Reaction Networks” Journal of Chemical Physics 144, 074104 (2016)

Includes the simulation code as well as post-processing scripts. Simualtions create data files.

To Do
- Read reaction network and rate information from an input file.
- Put modes for steady-state vs. transient

long term: Consider a Fortran implementation for speed
